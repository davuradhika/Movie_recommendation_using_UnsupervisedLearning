# Movie_recommendation_using_UnsupervisedLearning

Introduction
In today’s digital world, users are overwhelmed with the abundance of movie choices available across various platforms. As a result, deciding what to watch next has become increasingly difficult. Movie Recommendation Systems offer a practical solution to this issue by helping users discover movies tailored to their preferences, based on data and intelligent algorithms.

This project aims to build a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests similar movies to a given title using various metadata features such as genre, overview, cast, crew, and keywords. The recommendations are based on the similarity between movies, allowing the system to offer personalized suggestions without the need for explicit user ratings or interaction history.

Technologies and Tools Used
This project leverages the following tools and technologies: Python: Core programming language used for data processing and model development Pandas: For data cleaning, exploration, and manipulation of movie metadata NumPy: For numerical operations and efficient array handling Scikit-learn: For feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF Vectorization) and similarity measurement using cosine similarity Natural Language Processing (NLP): To process and vectorize text data such as movie overviews and keywords Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and visualization Matplotlib/Seaborn (optional): For data visualization and understanding patterns
